Prefix sum technique computes range sum queries in constant time over a fixed 1D array.

Range sum queries are two types:
1. Array is fixed
2. Array is not fixed. value can be updated . Here we use segment tree.


Two pointer technique: Iterating two pointers across an array to search for a pair of indices satisfying 
                    some condition in linear time. Usually two pointer technique works in a sorted array.

ex: find two numbers whose sum is k
    find pairs from array whose product is k, whose difference is 0.
